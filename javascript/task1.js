/* Task 1: Using the logical && operator
You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.

Create a variable named  score and set it to  8

Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".*/

// Score is greater the zero and score is lease the 10

// Variable name score and a value 8 is assigned to score 
var score = 8;
// Displaying true logical operator 
console.log("Mid-level skills:", score > 0 && score < 10);
