/* 

Specifically, I'm preparing to build the following inheritance hierarchy:

                  Animal
                  /    \
             Cat       Bird
          /               \          \
    HouseCat   Tiger      Parrot

There are two keywords that are essential for OOP with classes in JavaScript.

These keywords are extends and super.

The extends keyword allows me to inherit from an existing class.

Based on the above hierarchy, I can code the Animal class like this:
